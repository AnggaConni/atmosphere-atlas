# 🌫️ The Atlas of Atmosphere

**Evidence-Based Environmental Design for Human Performance & Well-Being**

The Atlas of Atmosphere is a research-driven web application that translates peer-reviewed psychological and physiological studies into actionable environmental design recommendations.

Rather than offering aesthetic inspiration, this tool provides scientifically grounded "atmosphere recipes" tailored to specific daily activities — such as focused work, deep rest, creative thinking, or exercise.

## 🧠 Core Concept

Human performance is shaped by environmental stimuli.

Lighting temperature, illumination intensity, color palette, ambient temperature, scent, and sound all influence cognitive arousal, emotional regulation, and physiological states.

This application operationalizes findings from:

- Environmental Psychology  
- Chronobiology  
- Cognitive Science  
- Arousal & Performance Theory  

Into practical, design-ready parameters.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Single Mode – Atmosphere Prescription View
Provides detailed environmental parameters for a selected activity:

- Recommended lighting temperature (Kelvin)
- Illumination intensity range
- Environmental temperature guidance
- Copyable HEX colour palettes
- Suggested sensory elements (sound & scent)
- Supporting scientific references

Designed for immediate practical application.

---

### ⚖️ Compare Mode – Environmental Trade-Off Analysis

Evaluate two activities side-by-side to understand:

- Differences in lighting requirements  
- Contrast in colour psychology  
- Shifts in sensory stimulation  
- Environmental intensity trade-offs  

This feature highlights a key insight:

> A single room cannot be optimized for all behaviors simultaneously.

Atmosphere is strategic.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- Remote knowledge workers  
- Interior designers seeking scientific justification  
- Workplace & HR designers  
- Wellness-oriented space planners  
- Behavioral design enthusiasts

## 🏗️ Design Philosophy

The Atlas of Atmosphere treats environment as behavioral infrastructure.

Environment → Cognitive Modulation → Performance Outcome

It is not a mood board.  
It is a protocol.

---

## 📌 Future Development Ideas

- Chronotype-based adaptation  
- Time-of-day adjustments  
- Intensity scaling (mild vs deep focus modes)  
- Smart-home integration  
- API for workplace or wellness platforms
